# Tailwind CSS Utilities

## Common Utility Patterns

### Flexbox Layouts
- `flex items-center`: Center items vertically
- `flex justify-between`: Space items evenly with space between
- `flex-col`: Stack items vertically
- `flex-wrap`: Allow items to wrap to next line

### Spacing
- `px-4 py-2`: Horizontal padding of 16px, vertical padding of 8px
- `my-4 mx-2`: Vertical margin of 16px, horizontal margin of 8px
- `space-x-4`: Add horizontal space between child elements
- `space-y-2`: Add vertical space between child elements

### Typography
- `text-sm text-gray-500`: Small, gray text for secondary information
- `font-medium`: Medium font weight for slightly emphasized text
- `truncate`: Truncate text with ellipsis when it overflows
- `leading-tight`: Tighter line height for headings

### Containers
- `container mx-auto`: Centered container with responsive width
- `max-w-md`: Maximum width constraints for elements
- `w-full`: Full width of parent container
- `h-screen`: Full viewport height

### Responsive Design
- `md:flex-row sm:flex-col`: Row layout on medium screens, column on small screens
- `lg:block md:hidden`: Show on large screens, hide on medium screens
- `sm:text-lg`: Larger text on small screens and up

## Best Practices

- Group related utilities by category (layout, spacing, typography)
- Keep class names organized in a consistent order
- Avoid extremely long chains of utility classes
- Extract commonly used patterns to components
- Use responsive utilities consistently across similar components
