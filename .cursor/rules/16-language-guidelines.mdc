# Language Guidelines

## English Usage Requirements

- All code comments must be written in English
- All documentation (READMEs, API docs, wikis) must be in English
- Git commit messages must always be in English
- Variable names, function names and class names must use English words
- Pull request descriptions and issue reports should be in English
- UI text should default to English (with i18n support for other languages)

## Commit Message Standards

- Write in present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Start with a type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep messages concise but descriptive
- Format: `type(scope): short description`
- Example: `feat(auth): implement JWT authentication`
